# Crack Kinematics
This repository contains the codes for computing crack kinematics using a binary mask that represents a segmented crack. The methodoly hereby implementes was presented in the paper ["Determing crack kinematics from imaged crack patterns"](https://link-url-here.org) by Pantoja-Rosero et., al.
